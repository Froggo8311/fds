This project is no longer activelt maintained. I tried to do an approach that was too much of a "this thing works kind of like linux I guess" emulator than something that would straight-up be a linux environment in the browser. I may continue this project again, but knowing now what I wish I would have known then, I will do more of a direct approach to running linux in the browser (and not trying to merge other projects into one). I will start again with a terminal while this time trying to perhaps implement bash, taking a more direct approach.

BrowserLinux is a web application aiming to enable a linux environment completely in the browser. It is currently licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/Froggo8311/BrowserLinux/blob/main/docs/LICENSE.md).

Please contribute if you feel you can help the development of this software! We are currently looking for people who are willing to add improvements and changes.

A running version is available on [Vercel](https://browserlinux.vercel.app), although it does not have the ability to install `blpm` packages.
